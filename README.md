# Golf-Handicap-Calculator
Creator: James Watson
In progress work on a golfers handicap calculator with a functional user interface. Will be able to store accounts and data for each player. 
Users will be able to create and login to their own index accounts. Each account will have a specified JSON file associated with it 
that will contain all entries to the index. These files will then be parsed and displayed in various ways in the User Interface. The UI
will display recent scores, calculate a handicap index, allow the user to make a new entry, and compare their index with other players
in the database.
